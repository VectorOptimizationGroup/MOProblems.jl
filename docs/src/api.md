# API Reference

This reference presents the docstrings of the types and functions shared by
the benchmark problems, including their signatures, arguments, and behavior.
For workflows that connect these APIs, see [Evaluation and Derivatives](@ref)
and [Catalog and Metadata](@ref).

## Evaluation

General constraints use the representation ``l_c \leq c(x) \leq u_c``, stored
in `prob.lcon` and `prob.ucon`. Rows with equal lower and upper bounds are
equalities; all other rows are inequalities. Objective and constraint
derivatives have separate evaluation functions.

Derivative metadata records whether an analytical evaluator is registered; it
does not assert differentiability at every boundary point of a benchmark's
domain. Family pages document problem-specific restrictions, and registered
evaluators may throw a `DomainError` where an analytical derivative is
undefined.
